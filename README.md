# Quantum Margulis Codes
This repository contains the parity check matrices of the quantum Margulis codes constructed in:
- M. Pacenti and B. Vasić, “Quantum Margulis Codes,” in 60th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing, Sep. 2024
- M. Pacenti, D. Chytas and B. Vasić, "Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes", arxiv

The parity check matrices are in sparse format, such that in the i-th row are listed the nonzero positions of the i-th row of the parity check matrix.
Notice that the indices start from 0.

In "Quantum Margulis Codes", each code is named as in the paper.
In "Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes", each code is named as "n_k_x/z", where n is the blocklength and k is the code dimension.
